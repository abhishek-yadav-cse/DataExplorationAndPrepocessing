# dataExploration-Prepocessing
In this tutorial we will use the San Diego Weather dataset included in the "daily_weather.csv" file. We will explore and then preprocess the dataset, dealing with missing values.

We start by reading the csv file into a dataframe (make sure to give the correct path when you run this).
